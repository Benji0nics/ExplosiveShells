      Explosive Shells are not directly related to the text provided, so I'll focus on explaining the University of Iowa's energy system and the challenge presented in the text.

      <p className="aboutPTwo">The University of Iowa's energy system is a critical component in providing energy to the campus, primarily through steam, electricity, and chilled water. This energy is utilized for heating, cooling, and powering various buildings across the campus. The historical approach involved generating energy at the campus power plant using methods such as burning energy pellets, biomass, and natural gas. However, there has been a shift towards renewable energy, evident in the installation of two solar arrays in the Sustainable Energy Discovery District.</p>
